# Small Downtime recorder

This tool was used for downtime recording before our SAP system go life.

The tool collects downtime data from each shift, in the data, a so called functional location is required for the repair, so that the frenquency of the breakdown can be record and analysed.

The spare parts which was used for the reparation is also a mandantory feld to fill in, if they are used. So that the consumption of them can also be tracked.

The tool supports immediate report and chart via excel and MS-Chart. Different forms of reports can be directly generated from the tool.
