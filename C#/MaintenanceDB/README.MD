# Small Downtime recorder

This tool was used for downtime recording in my responsible area before our SAP system goes life.

The tool collects downtime data from each shift, in the data, a so-called functional location is required for the repair, so that the frequency of the breakdown can be recorded and analysed.

The spare parts which were used for the repair is also a mandatory field to fill in if they are used. So that the consumption of them can also be tracked.

The tool supports immediate report and chart via excel and MS-Chart. Different forms of reports can be directly generated from the tool.
